# What is MagicaVoxel?
MagicaVoxel is a free 3D modeling software that is designed for ease of use and fun! Everything in MagicaVoxel is built out of cubes or voxels. Think pixel art but in 3D! No worrying about polygons, faces, vertices and textures. Stack your voxels upon another, change their colours, and make something cool!

_*tldr: building stuff in MagicaVoxel is like building stuff with lego*_

### Some cool stuff I've personally made:

As far as I can tell, it is made by one person named [@ephtracy](https://twitter.com/ephtracy) and is hosted at [https://ephtracy.github.io/](https://ephtracy.github.io/). If you haven't done so already, please download and install MagicaVoxel to continue with this workshop: [https://ephtracy.github.io/](https://ephtracy.github.io/).
